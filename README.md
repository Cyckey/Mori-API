### *amvstrm's API Fixed Fork*

This is **Mori**, a fixed fork of **amvstrm's API**, rewritten using **Elysia.js** and powered by **Bun**.  
The application is still under development, not ready for production, and some features remain untested.

### **Steps**:  
1. Clone the repository from the `bun` branch.  
2. Install dependencies.  
3. Run the application using the following command:  

```bash
bun run dev 
```
